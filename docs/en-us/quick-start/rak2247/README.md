## Product Background
The **RAK2247 LoRaWAN® Gateway Concentrator Module** is a LoRa® Concentrator module with mini-PCIe form factor based on the SX1301. This enables easy integration into routers and other networking equipment, adding LoRaWAN® Gateway capabilities. The module can be used in any embedded platform offering a mini-PCIe slot with an SPI or USB connection.

Despite its small size, the device is an 8 channel concentrator module. By integrating it together with a computing core, a fully fledged LoRaWAN® Gateway solution can easily be created.
