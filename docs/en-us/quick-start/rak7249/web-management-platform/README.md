"XXXX" is the last two bytes of the Gateway MAC address. To access the Web Management Platform, input the IP Address: **192.168.230.1** in your Web browser.

### WAN Port (DHCP IP) Mode
Connect the RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway's ETH Port located at the rear panel to your Router using an Ethernet Cable. Same as with the Wi-Fi AP mode, the same IP Address: `192.168.230.1` shall be used to access the Web Management Platform.

### WAN Port Direct Connection
Connect the RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway's ETH Port located at the rear panel to your PC using an Ethernet Cable. By default, the IP address of the RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway's Ethernet interface is 192.168.10.10, so you need to set the IP address of your PCâ€™s Ethernet to the same network segment, for example, 192.168.10.20. You can then access the Web Management Platform using the Gateway's IP Address:`192.168.10.10`.

You can now then Proceed to the Web Management Platform document for the detailed configurations based on your specific application.
