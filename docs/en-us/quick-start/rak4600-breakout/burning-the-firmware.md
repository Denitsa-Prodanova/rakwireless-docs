# Burning the Bootloader into the Device

The RAK4600 LPWAN Evaluation Board bootloader is already pre-installed upon manufacturing so this bootloader flashing is not necessary for you to perform. If you find that the bootloader of your RAK4600 LPWAN Breakout Module damaged, kindly contact our support though our [RAKwireless forum](https://forum.rakwireless.com/).
