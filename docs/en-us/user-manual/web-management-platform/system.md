### General Settings

The system time is displayed here. Additionally, you can edit the Host Name and select the Time zone. Another way to get the correct time is to use Timing Synchronization. You can Enable NTP client mode, enable NTP server and provide server candidate URLs.

:::tip üìù NOTE
Time Synchronization tab is displayed in all System sub-menus.

### Logging

### Language

By default, this is in Auto (English), however you can choose from several options including German, Spanish, Russian, etc.

## 2. Administration

- **Generate archive**: Downloads an archive of the current configuration
- **Perform reset**: Resets the Gateway to the default settings
- **Restore**: You can upload a previously generated archive to restore the configuration settings at the time of its making
- **Flash new firmware**: Update the firmware by flashing a bin file. Use the button to select the location of the new firmware file and the blue button to initiate the flashing process. There is a tick box to toggle the option of keeping the current settings of the gateway

:::tip üìù NOTE
The **Keep Settings** check box is selected by default, as unchecking it will results in having a Gateway with stock settings after the firmware update.
:::

## 5. Reboot

Reboots the gateway. All unsaved changes will be discarded. This is not a reset in any way and only power cycles the device. All configuration settings will be left intact.
