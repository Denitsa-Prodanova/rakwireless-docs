### Product Background

**RAK2287** is an LPWAN Concentrator Module with mini-PCle form factor based on **Semtech SX1302.** This enables easy integration to existing routers and other network equipment with LoRaWAN® Gateway capabilities, and can be used in any embedded platform offering mini-PCIe slot with SPI or USB connection. Additionally, this card is equipped with **ZOE-M8Q GPS** chip providing pinpoint location accuracy.

This module is an exceptional, complete and cost efficient LoRaWAN® gateway solution offering up to 10 programmable parallel demodulation paths, an 8 x 8 channel LoRa® packet detectors, 8 x SF5-SF12 LoRa® demodulators and 8 x SF5-SF10 LoRa® demodulators. It is capable of detecting uninterrupted combination of packets at 8 different spreading factors and 10 channels with continuous demodulation of up to 16 packets. This product is best for smart metering fixed networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, that can cover of up to 500 nodes per km² in an environment of moderate interference.
