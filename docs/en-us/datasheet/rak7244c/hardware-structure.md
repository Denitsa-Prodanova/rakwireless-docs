## VI. Hardware Structure

The RAK7244C Pro version consisted of a RAK2245 Pi Hat and RAK2013 Pi HAT

### RAK2245 Pi Hat

The **RAK2245 Pi HAT** is an LPWAN Gateway Concentrator Module based on the Pi HAT standard, and can be mounted to Pi board with 40-pin connector. The image below shows the hardware structure of the LoRa® portion which describes the integration between RAK2245 and Raspberry Pi 4.

### RAK2013 Pi HAT

The RAK2013 is an add-on board based on the Raspberry Pi HAT standard that can transmit UART data from Raspberry Pi to the Cellular network. It supports several cellular protocol, such as NB-IOT, CAT-M, CAT1 or CAT 4, by choosing different modular on the board. The device is capable of integrating audio codec and audio amplifier along with the carrier operator's network, plus it supports Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) function. It is easy to use with the earphone connector, MIC connector and speaker connector having audio amplifier.
